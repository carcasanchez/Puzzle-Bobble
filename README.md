# Puzzle-Bobble
Puzzle Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito Corporation, inspired by a previous game of the same company, Bubble Bobble. 
His name comes from Bub and Bob, the two dinosaurs who manage the bubble cannon in the game.

The version we will do is the original one released in June 1994, also known as Bust-a-Move.

Our team (Carlos Cabreira, Marc Latorre, Jordi Oña, Andreu Rojas and Fran Ruiz) is going to recreate this game.
